				<h3>Getting Ready for Class</h3>
				<small>by Belia Vargas</small>
				<p>As a single mother I tend to look forward to going to school in the mornings. My youngest daughter tends to be my alarm, but last night she decided to wake up at 2 a.m. and stay up until 4 a.m. so i didn't feel well rested. So as I woke up to get ready and woke up my other children I stumbled around like a zombie.</p>
				<p>	When I finally get dressed and the kids ready I head to my parents house. After I drop the kids off I make my way to class. Traffic this morning sucked because I left late. But the building where they are holding the class isn't too far from my parents house so I didn't have to wait too long in traffic.</p>
				<p>	When I arrived at the parking garage and walked over to the building I debated wether or not to buy a coffe. Eventually I decided not to buy one because it was already getting hot. As I walked into class I noticed how alot of students were not there yet. I thought I was going to be super late but other students arrived after I did so I didn't feel so bad.</p>

				<h3>My School Day</h3>
				<small>by Belia Vargas</small>
				<p>When school started today I was a little frustrated. My baby decided to push the power button on my computer last night while it was installing updates, so this morning I had to wait for it to uninstall and reinstall. Once my teacher was ready to teach my computer finished so that made me happy. My teacher and his assistant are awesome. They make it pretty easy to understand what is going on and how to do the html codes.</p>
				<p>I can honestly say the only thing I don't care for is the long lunch. But it came in handy today since my daughter called and said she left my daughters diaper bag in the car. So having that long lunch gave me time to drive to my parents house to drop it off and still have time to grab a bite to eat. We were also told we could only eat in a particular break room, no one seemed to know where it was though. I found it and I did let everyone know exactly where in the building it was located.</p>
				<p>After lunch we just jumped right back into where we left off. I am finding that I am catching on to the material quite well and finished my page right away. When our teacher checked our work he said my page was done right and didn't see anything I needed to correct. Our class is catching on so quickly that he was impressed how far we have gotten in only two days.</p>

				<h3>Returning Home</h3>
				<small>by Belia Vargas</small>
				<p>After class finished today I went and picked up only three of my children. My son had already been picked up by his father for a doctors appointment. As I picked up my girls they decided to snitch on their brother by telling me he took his tablet with him. I don"t mind my kids taking their tablets with them places as long as they ask me if it is ok. So I did get a little upset with my son.</p>
				<p>I left my parents house as quickly as possible, since my ex-husband was already waiting in front of my house to drop off my son. So now I am home trying to write this blog and my kids are already starting to get too out of hand. I told them they needed to sit down and watch t.v. until I finished what I told them was homework. But of course they did not listen to me. Every 5 minutes they have already asked me a million questions.</p>
				<p>The joys of parenting lol. But even though my children are starting to run around like chickens with their heads cut off, I would never want them to change. So for now I will say goodbye and will post another day.</p>
