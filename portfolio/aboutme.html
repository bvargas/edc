				<h2>Welcome to my page,</h2>
				<h3>Thank you for your interest in learning who Belia Vargas is....</h3>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>Well where do I start...I am a single mother of 4 children and because of my children I strive to succeed at everything I do. I haven't accomplished everything I want to do but that will not stop me from trying.</p>
				<p>I went to Caruthers High School and graduated with a 3.11. My best subject in high school was math. I was also captain of the colorguard team. Being part of colorguard and being the captain really helped me with my creativity. It helped me due to the fact that I created the routines for the music the band played at parades and halftime shows. Also being good in math has helped me to find different ways in solving problems. Not just math problems but any problem. It helps me look at the situation and think of different possibilities to the situation and which one will be best for me to take.</p>
				<p>After I graduated high school I went to Fresno City College for a couple sememsters. I did not complete college because I met someone and ended up pregnant and married. But while I was attending Fresno City I was working as a cashier at a little family owned store in Easton, Ca. called The Big Potato Market. Working for this store was a great experience. I showed that I have a great memory for codes, I could also mutli-task well and I had great customer service skills.</p>
				<p>After working for The Big Potato Market I stopped working due to my first pregnancy, but after my daughter was born I returned to work. I started working a seasonal job as a mail clerk for The Internal Revenue Service. I worked for the IRS for two seasons. I really enjoyed my workplace. We were expected to meet a quota of how many envelopes to open and sort, but I never felt pressure to meet the quota. I always met my quota and did more than the goal.</p>

				<p>Even though I was required to work at a fast pace I never lost attention to detail on what we were required to look for when sorting the tax forms. But after two seasons with the IRS I was blessed with another pregnancy. I had twins and I knew I couldn't just do seasonal jobs anymore I wanted something more full-time. That is when I started working for USPS Re-Encoding Center.</p>
				<p>My job at the re-encoding center really helped with my typing skills. I had to type at a rate that I thought I would never be able to do but I did and I exceeded the speed. My job was to look for the missing information on a letter and enter the code for it to be processed. So not only did this job help my typing speed but it also helped with my memory again. Just like the cashier job by entering codes. Unfortunately the center was shut down. After this job I took a long break from working.</p>
				<p>But after some bad situations I decided it was time to go back to work. I started working as extra help with County of Fresno. The first department I worked for was Department of Behavioral Health as an Office Assistant. I really enjoyed working with the public again. I checked people in for appointments. I called people to reschedule appointments. I helped prepare doctors schedules daily. But I did'nt stay at Behavioral Health long, I was offered a permanent position with County Counsel.</p>
				<p>County Counsel was a little different from Behavioral Health since I did not work with the public, but I still had the position of an Office Assistant. I helped file documents in their case files. I had retrieved cases for the attorneys I worked for and set them out before court. I would calendar their court dates for them through microsoft outlook calendars. I would also get paperwork showing what cases needed to be closed and opened in the computer system.</p>
				<p>But even though I am no longer working for County of Fresno that did not stop me from doing something in life. I am now a EDC student with Bitwise. I am learning how to develop web pages. I have learned HTML coding and how to style the page with CSS and SCSS. I believe that with my background with learning codes is making it easier for me to learn the codes in this class. I know that I will succeed in this class just like I know I will succeed with anything I put my mind to, because I am a strong and determined person. But for now that is who Belia Vargas is but not for long since I still have so much ahead in life to try and to succeed at, so I hope you enjoyed getting to know me so far.</p>
